* TODO write dnsop with options:
  1. individual codes, per existing doc
  2. 16 bit code field, with 16 bit lookup field based on rcode
  3. 32 bit code field, repeating rcode from elsewhere in the packet
  4. integer ranges where NNYY indicates the NN integer rcode and YY
     indicates the sub-code.  Note that this needs a 32 bit field too
* TODO can we include more than one error code?
  + [ ] more than one edns0 rr, should be able to
  + [ ] more than one odns0 sub-option; don't know
* TODO what would a forwarding server do?
  1. always send back edns0?
  2. never send back edns0
  3. send if server believes client can receive it
* TODO informative code to add: type any only one type of data
* TODO set the 1 bit as a flag and reserve the other 15 bits are unused...
  + but not necessarily flags
* TODO unauthenticated errors?  see Paul Wouters
  + can we secure them?
  + it doesn't matter anyway
  + they're just informational
