    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extensible method to return additional
      information about the cause of DNS errors. The primary use case is to
      extend SERVFAIL to provide additional information about the cause of DNS
      and DNSSEC failures.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction and background">
      <t>There are many reasons that a DNS query may fail, some of them
      transient, some permanent; some can be resolved by querying another
      server, some are likely best handled by stopping resolution.
      Unfortunately, the error signals that a DNS server can return are very
      limited, and are not very expressive. This means that applications and
      resolvers often have to "guess" at what the issue is - e.g the answer
      was marked REFUSED because of a lame delegation, or because of a lame
      delegation or because the nameserver is still starting up and loading
      zones? Is a SERVFAIL a DNSSEC validation issue, or is the nameserver
      experiencing a bad hair day?</t>

      <t>A good example of issues that would benefit by additional error
      information is an error caused by a DNSSEC validation issue. When a stub
      resolver queries a DNSSEC bogus name (using a validating resolver), the
      stub resolver receives only a SERVFAIL in response. Unfortunately,
      SERVFAIL is used to signal many sorts of DNS errors, and so the stub
      resolver simply asks the next configured DNS resolver. The result of
      trying the next resolver is one of two outcomes: either the next
      resolver also validates, a SERVFAIL is returned again, and the user gets
      an (largely) incomprehensible error message; or the next resolver is not
      a validating resolver, and the user is returned a potentially harmful
      result.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to extend (or annotate) DNS
      errors to provide additional information about the cause of the error.
      When properly authenticated, this information can be used by the
      resolver to make a decision regarding whether or not to retry or it can
      be used or by technical users attempting to debug issues.</t>

          <t>OPTION-CODE, 2 octets (defined in [RFC6891]), for ExtError is
          TBD.</t>

          <t>OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets ((defined in [RFC6891]) contains
          the length of the payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH)
          in octets and should be 6 plus the length of the EXTRA-TEXT
          section (which may be a zero-length string).</t>

          <t>RESERVED, 2 octets; the first bit (R) indicates a flag defined in
          this specification. The remaining bits are reserved for future use,
          potentially as additional flags.</t>

          <t>RESPONSE-CODE, 2 octets: this SHOULD be a copy of the RCODE from
          the primary DNS packet. When including multiple extended error EDNS0
          records in a response in order to provide additional error
          information, the RESPONSE-CODE MAY be a different RCODE.</t>

          <t>INFO-CODE, 2 octets.</t>

          <t>A variable length EXTRA-TEXT field holding additional textual
          information. It may be zero length when no additional textual
          information is included.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Currently the only defined flag is the R flag. <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="R - Retry">The R (or Retry) flag provides a hint to the
          receiver that it should retry the query, probably by querying
          another server. If the R bit is set (1), the sender believes that
          retrying the query may provide a successful answer next time; if the
          R bit is clear (0), the sender believes that it should not ask
          another server.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The remaining bits in the RESERVED field are reserved for future use
      and MUST be set to 0 by the sender and SHOULD be ignored by the
      receiver.</t>

      <t>INFO-CODE: A code point that, when combined with the RCODE from the
      DNS packet, serve as a joint-index into the IANA "Extended DNS Errors"
      registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use of the Extended DNS Error option">
      <t>The Extended DNS Error (EDE) is an EDNS option. It can be included in
      any error response (SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, REFUSED, etc) to a query that
      includes an EDNS option. This document includes a set of initial
      codepoints (and requests to the IANA to add them to the registry), but
      is extensible via the IANA registry to allow additional error and
      information codes to be defined in the future.</t>

      <t>The R (Retry) flag provides a hint (or suggestion) as to what the
      receiver may want to do with this annotated error. The mechanism is
      specifically designed to be extensible, and so implementations may
      receive EDE codes that it does not understand. The R flag allows
      implementations to make a decision as to what to do if it receives a
      response with an unknown code - retry or drop the query. Note that this
      flag is only a suggestion or hint. Unless a protective transport
      mechanism (like TSIG <xref target="RFC2845"/> or TLS <xref
      target="RFC8094"/>) is used, the bit's value could have have been
      altered by a person-in-the-middle. Receivers can choose to ignore this
      hint.</t>

      <t>The EXTRA-INFO textual field may be zero-length, or may hold
      additional information useful to network operators.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Defined Extended DNS Errors">
      <t>This document defines some initial EDE codes. The mechanism is
      intended to be extensible, and additional codepoints will be registered
      in the "Extended DNS Errors" registry. This document provides
      suggestions for the R flag, but the originating server may ignore these
      recommendations if it knows better.</t>

      <t>The RESPONSE-CODE and the INFO-CODE from the EDE EDNS option is used
      to serve as a double index into the "Extended DNS Error codes" IANA
      registry, the initial values for which are defined in the following

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>DNSSEC is being deployed - unfortunately a significant number of
      clients (~11% according to <xref target="GeoffValidation"/>), when
      receiving a SERVFAIL from a validating resolver because of a DNSSEC
      validaion issue simply ask the next (non-validating) resolver in their
      list, and don't get any of the protections which DNSSEC should provide.
      This is very similar to a kid asking his mother if he can have another
      cookie. When the mother says "No, it will ruin your dinner!", going off
      and asking his (more permissive) father and getting a "Yes, sure,
      cookie!".</t>

      <t>This information is unauthenticated information, and an attacker (e.g
      MITM or malicious recursive server) could insert an extended error
      response into already untrusted data &mdash; ideally clients and
      resolvers would not trust any unauthenticated information, but until we
      live in an era where all DNS answers are authenticated via DNSSEC or
      other mechanisms, there are some tradeoffs. As an example, an attacker
      who is able to insert the DNSSEC Bogus Extended Error into a packet
      could instead simply reply with a fictitious address (A or AAAA) record.
      The R bit hint and extended error information are informational -
      implementations can choose how much to trust this information and
      validating resolvers / stubs may choose to put a different weight on
      it.</t>
