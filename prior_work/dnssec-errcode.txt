===========================================
3 * 2 * 2 = 12 combinations                     
5 classes of increasing functionality 
	identify new error codes in each class
===========================================

1. [oblivious-oblivious]
   (Security oblivious) X (security oblivious) X (security oblivious) 

	0	No error condition.  									RFC 1035
	1	Format error - The name server was unable to			RFC 1035 
		interpret the query.
	2	Server failure - The name server was unable to			RFC 1035 
		process this query due to a problem with the 
		name server.	
	3	Name Error - Meaningful only for responses from 		RFC 1035
		an authoritative name server, this code signifies 
		that the domain name referenced in the query does
		not exist.	
	4	Not Implemented - The name server does not support		RFC 1035 
		the requested kind of query.
	5	Refused - The name server refuses to perform the 		RFC 1035
		specified operation for policy reasons. 
		For example, a name server may not wish to provide 
		the information to the particular requester, 
		or a name server may not wish to perform a particular 
		operation (e.g., zone transfer) for particular data.	
	6	YXDOMAIN - Some name that ought not to exist, 			RFC 2136
		does exist
	7	YXRRSET - Some RRset that ought not to exist,			RFC 2136
		does exist
	8	NXRRSET - Some RRset that ought to exist,				RFC 2136
		does not exist
	9	NOTAUTH - The server is not authoritative for			RFC 2136
		the zone named in the Zone section
	10	NOTZONE - A name used in the prerequisite or update		RFC 2136 
		section is not within the zone denoted by the 
		zone section
	11 - 15	Reserved.	 



2. [aware-oblivious]

   (security aware non-validating) X (security aware) X (security oblivious) 
   (security aware validating) X (security aware) X (security oblivious)

	XX	NOCLRPATH - one or more intermediate servers							
		does not support DNSSEC 
		(can be identified through EDNS0)
	XX	LCLPOL - some local policy decision has contributed					
		to the resultant set of RRs (accepting unsigned responses, accepting
		authoritative data as authentic).

Cases to consider include parent initiated communication to the child (notify/local policy)



4. [aware-aware]
   (security aware non-validating) X (security aware) X (security aware) 

	16	BADVERS - Bad OPT Version.								RFC 2671
		BADSIG - TSIG Signature Failure.						RFC 2845
	17	BADKEY -  Key not recognized.							RFC 2845
	18	BADTIME - Signature out of time window.					RFC 2845
	19	BADMODE - Bad TKEY Mode.								RFC 2930
	20	BADNAME - Duplicate or unknown key name.				RFC 2930
	21	BADALG - Algorithm not supported.						RFC 2930


	XX	NODNSKEY - DNSKEY missing, was expected to be			
		present
	XX	NORRSIG - RRSIG missing, should have been present
	XX	NONSEC - NSEC missing, should have been present
	XX	NOSIG - Signature missing, but was expected to be
		present 

	NODS == INDETERMINATE
	How can we distinguish between NODS and NONSEC (proving the absence of DS)


	XX	NOTZONEKEY - The DNSKEY does not have the 
		zone flag bit set

	XX	SIGEXP - Signature required to be present 
		(DS, trusted anchor), was present but has expired
	XX	SIGNOTACT - Signature required to be present 
		(DS, trusted anchor), was present but is not yet valid 
	XX	BOGUS - Signature required to be present (DS), 
		was present but failed validation
	XX	INDERMINATE - No trusted chain of keys could be found 
		that would allow verification of the signatures
	XX	UNSECURE - No signatures present, not required to be 
		present (DS)




5. [validating-aware]
   (security aware validating) X (security aware) X (security aware)
		
	XX	LCLPOL - local policy would have otherwise rejected 
		the record but for the CD bit
